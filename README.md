<p><b>First commit</b> contains setup of the settings.py file, redirecting the urls from project to app, adding static and template directories as well as a base.html file. I also uploaded the .ini file, which normally would be included in a gitignore. I did so for instructional purposes to demonstrate what could be in that file</p>
<p><b>Second commit</b>contained models and followed migration of models</p>
